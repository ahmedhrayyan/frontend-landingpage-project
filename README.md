## About

This project is the second project for Udacity Frontend Nanodegree

The starter files had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. My job was to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Development
You can use npm [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) package to run a local development server.

The installation of the package globally can be  done by running `npm -g i serve` or `sudo npm -g i serve` in a linux machine and after the installation in complete change to the project directory and just run the command `serve` and you're good to go.
